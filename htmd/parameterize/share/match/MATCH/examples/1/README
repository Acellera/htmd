Example 1:

This is simple example on how to generate a topology and parameter file for a novel ligand and load it into CHARMM using a charmm script

MATCH.pl -forcefield top_all36_cgenff test.pdb 

This generates test.rtf and test.prm which are the CHARMM topology and parameter files for this ligand respectively

charmm < minimize_ligand.inp > minimize_ligand.out

open minimize_ligand.out to confirm that there are no error in the loading of this molecule into charmm, it is also worth checking the energy, in this case we get 6.88660 kcal/mole in a vacuum which seems reasonable
