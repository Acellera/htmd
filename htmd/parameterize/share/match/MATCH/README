MATCH Version 0.01

INSTALL

two paths need to be set 

MATCH = clonepath/MATCH/MATCH
PerlChemistry = clonepath/MATCH/PerlChemistry

in OSX this is done by

export MATCH=clonepath/MATCH/MATCH
export PerlChemistry=clonepath/MATCH/PerlChemistry

in linux 

setenv MATCH clonepath/MATCH/MATCH
setenv PerlChemistry clonepath/MATCH/PerlChemistry

This needs to be done to tell perl where the perl packages are

Also to use any script they need to be chmod +x to execute.

example for MATCH.pl

chmod +x clonepath/MATCH/MATCH/scripts/MATCH.pl

BASIC INFO 

in MATCH/MATCH

/lib is the location of all the perl module files are located

/resources contains all the default MATCH libraries for each forcefield currently implemented in MATCH, there is also a .par files for each forcefield which gives you the default parameters for a given force field when 

MATCH.pl -forcefield forcefieldname 

is used. Strongly recommended not to change the parameters in this file but to override them on the command line by 

MATCH.pl -forcefield forcefieldname -parametername parametervalue

within each force field directory, for example /resources/top_all22_prot:

  top_all22_prot.inp and par_all22_prot.prm: these are the standard CHARMM topology and parameter files

  top_all22_prot.types: This is the .types file that contains all of the atom-type molecular fragment declarations in super smiles string form, this is required for atom typing, see file for format

  top_all22_prot.incr: The bond increment rule file, required for atom charging

  top_all22_prot.trans: Refining increment rule file, used in atom charging but is not required

  top_al22_prot.rm: the relation matrix file, this is required for parameter substitution, contains the calculated values of how related on atom type is to another.

  top_all22_prot.impr: improper assignment rule file, required to assigning improper angles to enforce geometry.

  top_all22_prot.patches: used to assign topology patches to molecules while generating type strings, bond increments, etc

/scripts contains all executed scripts for MATCH

/t contains all test scripts used to validate MATCH, contains many scripts discussed in publication

EXAMPLE USAGE 

MATCH.pl

MATCH.pl -forcefield top_all36_cgenff test.pdb 

  Create a topology and parameter file for molecule in test.pdb using the CGENFF force field, will be names test.rtf and test.prm

MATCH.pl -forcefield top_all22_prot -CreatePdb test.mol 

 Generates a topology and parameter file for the molecule within test.mol, in addition it outputs CHARMM formatted pdb

MATCH.pl -forcefield top_all35_carb test1.mol2 test2.mol2 test3.mol2

 Generates a topology file for the molecule found in test1, test2, and test3. Only one parameter file will be generated that will contain all of the parameters for test1, test2, and test3.

GenerateBondIncrementRules.pl

GenerateBondIncrementRules.pl -TopologyFile test.rtf

  constructs bond increment rules that best describe the given CHARMM topology file test.rtf

GenerateBondIncrementRules.pl -TopologyFile test.rtf -PatchFile test.patches

  constructs bond increment rules that best describe the given CHARMM topology file test.rtf using the rules described in test.patches to generate proper reside topology.

IMPORTANT NOTES

When preparing a molecule to be processed by MATCH.pl

  1. All hydrogens are required!, if you do not add hydrogens you will get the wrong result!!!!!
  2. for pdbs make sure that the formatting is good, for those have have access to MMTSB toolset, use convpdb.pl will save you a lot of time
  3. Make sure that there is only 1 molecule in the pdb, you may get the incorrect result if you there are multiple residue numbers


When processing multiple molecules at once, parameters will be pooled into the parameter file with the name of the first file that was specified
