# HTMD main repository
HTMD (high-throughput molecular dynamics) is a programmable, extensible platform written in Python. 
It provides a complete workspace for simulation-based discovery through MD while aiming to solve the data generation and analysis problem as well as increase reproducibility.

HTMD is free for academia.
For commerial use, Acellera provides licenses through https://www.acellera.com/contact/.
