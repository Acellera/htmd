# HTMD: Programming Environment for Molecular Discovery

[HTMD](https://www.htmd.org) (acronym for High-Throughput Molecular Dynamics) is a programmable, extensible platform
written in Python. It provides a complete workspace for simulation-based discovery through molecular simulations while
aiming to solve the data generation and analysis problem as well as increase reproducibility.

## Licensing

HTMD Community Edition is free to use for non-profit work. Contact Acellera
[www.acellera.com/contact](https://www.acellera.com/contact/) for information on the full version HTMD Pro or if you need a different license.
