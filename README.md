# HTMD main repository
HTMD (high-throughput molecular dynamics) is a programmable, extensible platform written in Python.
It provides a complete workspace for simulation-based discovery through molecular simulations while aiming to solve the data generation and analysis problem as well as increase reproducibility.

HTMD basic is free for non-profit organizations, like universities.

HTMD pro requires a license. Acellera provides licenses through https://www.acellera.com/contact/.

### Download HTMD
HTMD can be downloaded from www.htmd.org. If you want to use this git repository, still download it using conda first to have all dependencies and then set PYTHONPATH to the git directory.

### HTMD documentation and tutorials
Documentation and tutorials of HTMD can be found on https://www.htmd.org.
