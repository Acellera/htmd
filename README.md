# HTMD main repository
[HTMD](https://www.htmd.org) (high-throughput molecular dynamics) is a programmable, extensible platform written in Python.
It provides a complete workspace for simulation-based discovery through molecular simulations while aiming to solve the data generation and analysis problem as well as increase reproducibility.

HTMD basic is free for non-profit organizations, like universities.

HTMD pro requires a license. Acellera provides licenses through [www.acellera.com/contact](https://www.acellera.com/contact/).

### Download HTMD
HTMD can be downloaded from [www.htmd.org](www.htmd.org). If you want to use this Git 
repository, still download it using conda first to have all dependencies and then 
set PYTHONPATH to the git directory. (Installation through PyPI is experimental.) 

### HTMD documentation and tutorials
Documentation and tutorials of HTMD can be found on [www.htmd.org](www.htmd.org). 
Please report bugs via [GitHub Issues](https://github.org/acellera/htmd/issues).
