# HTMD: Programming Environment for Molecular Discovery
[HTMD](https://www.htmd.org) (acronym for High-Throughput Molecular Dynamics) is a programmable, extensible platform 
written in Python. It provides a complete workspace for simulation-based discovery through molecular simulations while 
aiming to solve the data generation and analysis problem as well as increase reproducibility.

## Licensing
HTMD Community Edition is free to use for non-profit work. Contact Acellera 
[www.acellera.com/contact](https://www.acellera.com/contact/) for information on the full version HTMD Pro or if you need a different license.

## Download HTMD

### Using released versions
HTMD is distributed through conda package manager. The instructions for downloading HTMD can be found in
[https://software.acellera.com/download.html](https://software.acellera.com/download.html). 

### Using this repository 
If you want to use this repository, we recommend to still download a released version of HTMD to have all dependencies 
and then set PYTHONPATH to the git directory.
