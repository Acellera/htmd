Installation
============

If you are a non-profit entity, you can download a free version of HTMD which does not have all functionalities of the Pro-version.

The Pro-version requires a license, which is linked to acceptance of the end user License agreement (EULA).

If you do not have a license, please contact us. If you already have a license, please follow the instructions here below.

Installing HTMD
---------------

With conda, you can easily install HTMD by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:
    
    conda install -c acellera -c conda-forge htmd

Before using HTMD, please read the EULA and register using the command

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    htmd_register

If you don't accept the EULA and register at this point, HTMD will prompt for registration when the Python module is imported
