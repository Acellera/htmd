Building
========

Building is the most important module for preparing Molecules for simulation. HTMD includes tools to solvate molecular
systems in water, prepare proteins for simulation by assigning appropriate protonation states, and can build all the
necessary files to simulate the system in either two of the most widely used force-fields, CHARMM and AMBER.
