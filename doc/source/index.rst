What is it?
===========

HTMD is a molecular-specific programmable environment to prepare, handle, simulate, visualize and analyze molecular systems.
HTMD is based on Python, so scientists can easily extend it to their needs. With HTMD is possible to do very
complex protocols in just few lines.

In a single script, it is possible to plan an entire computational experiment, from manipulating PDBs, building,
executing and analyzing simulations, computing Markov state models, kinetic rates, affinities and pathways.
