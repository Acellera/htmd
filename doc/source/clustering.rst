Clustering
==========

Clustering is done using the [scikit-learn clustering library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering). 
But other clustering classes can be used as well as long as they adhere to the same interface (methods: fit, attributes: cluster_centers_, labels_)
