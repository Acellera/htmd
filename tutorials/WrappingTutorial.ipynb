    "## Periodic boundary conditions (PBC)\n",
    "Molecular dynamics simulations are highly computationally expensive. We are only able to simulate up to a few hundreds of thousands of atoms for relatively short durations up to a few seconds. The simulation time and computational requirements increase linearly with the number of atoms in our system. Thus we try to keep our systems small to speed up our simulations. \n",
    "However a small isolated system does not reflect the reality inside our cells where molecules are located in large amounts of solvent. Thus we use periodic boundary conditions to immitate a simulation in infinite space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this mean?\n",
    "It means that when we calculate interactions between the atoms, we pretend that our simulation \"box\" has on every side of it a copy of itself and the copies have copies on their sides etc etc, thus creating an infinite space. These copies we call \"periodic images\" of our simulation box. In reality however we are only simulating a single box using \"periodic boundary conditions\".\n",

    "2. Let them continue moving outside of the box\n",

    "## Wrapping\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where wrapping comes in play. Wrapping is the term used for placing all the atoms back into a single simulation box. Since we know the size of our box and the absolute position of our atom, it's trivial to move all atoms back to a single box (wrap them back).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does wrapping work?\n",
    "While we do know the box size, one question remains for wrapping. What becomes now the center of our box? Unfortunately since our systems drift in space freely during a simulation it's not practical to decide the center of our box in a single set of XYZ coordinates.\n",
    "\n",

Of course this is just an artifact of wrapping, there is no vacuum there, instead the part of the protein which sticks out on the left actually occupies that space on the other sides of the box. However we have decided to keep bonded molecules intact instead of breaking them apart when wrapping for aesthetical reasons which is why this occurs."

In the bellow case the proteins are in contact so we can wrap on the average coordinates of both but if our simulation has unbinding events, wrapping on the average of both could create an ugly visualization and we might need to select one or the other as the center of our wrapping.\n",
