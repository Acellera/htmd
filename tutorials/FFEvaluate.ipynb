    "HTMD provides the FFEvaluate module which allows the easy evaluation of molecular mechanics force-fields. This serves multiple purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Application development__: Many computational biology applications require the evaluation of energies between molecules. This allows faster development of applications based on those energies.\n",
    " * __Educational__: Most molecular dynamics codes are either closed source or written in a highly optimized manner making them hard to understand. The FFEvaluate code has been written in python numba which makes it easy to read, improve and extend.\n",
    " * __Debugging__: FFEvaluate can provide a detailed breakdown of all energies and visualization of forces which helps debug problems in a MD simulation or parameterization.\n",
    " \n",
    "We would like to acknowledge [parmed](), an awesome python library which FFEvaluate uses to parse forcefield parameters."

    "\n",
    "While FFEvaluate provides an easy and fast way of obtaining MM energies and forces, the user should be aware of some pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The code is still in beta. There are some less-user or older force-field features which are not yet supported (i.e. Urey-Bradley types, explicit AMBER 1-4 exclusions)\n",
    " * It will never be as fast as professional MD codes. The purpose of `FFEvaluate` is to make an easily usable and understandable MM evaluation code. Therefore on systems with large amount of non-bonded interations such as solvated systems with many waters the code __will__ take a long time to evaluate the energies and forces.\n",
    " * Speed improvements such as cell-lists for non-bonded interations and particle-mesh Ewald are not implemented (but could be in the future). FFEvaluate will calculate all non-bonded interactions explicitly.\n",
    " * Implicit solvent calculations are still missing but might be added in the future.\n",
