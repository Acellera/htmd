    "## Adaptive Bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "* Adaptive sampling algorithms usually employ empirical policies, and they are not based on any mathematical decission process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We descrive adaptive sampling in terms of a multi-armed bandit problem to develop a novel adaptive sampling algorithm, Adaptive Bandit [ref], providing strong fundamentals to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma faced in adaptive sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adaptive Bandit is framed into a reinforcement-learning based framework, using an action-value function and an upper confidence bound selection algorithm, improving adaptive sampling’s performance and versatility when faced against different free energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discretized conformational states are defined as actions, and each action has an associated reward distribution. When an action is picked, the algorithm computes the associated reward for that action, based on MSM free energy estimations, and applies a policy to select the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaptiveBandit relies on the UCB1 algorithm to optimize the action-picking policy, defining an upper confidence bound for each action based on the number of times the agent has picked that action and the total number of actions taken"
