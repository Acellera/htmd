    "## Concept\n",
    "* Exploration of the conformational space using MD simulations can waste lots of simulation time sampling the same conformational regions which does not provide any new knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead it would be desireable to explore more under-sampled regions of the conformational space, to overcome energetic barriers and eventually reach the desired conformation (folded protein / bound ligand etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In adaptive sampling, instead of launching thousands of simulations at once from a small set of initial structures as in naive high-throughput MD, simulations are launched in sequential batches called epochs utilizing knowledge of the conformational space obtained from all previous epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The starting points of the simulations in each epoch are chosen based on some criteria; in this case, it selects conformations from the most undersampled conformational regions detected in all previous simulations. This is done by using Markov state models which discretize the conformational space into a set of most metastable states. Then the starting conformations are sampled based on a distribution related to the population of each state.\n",

    "## How to start\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive creates multiple directories which it uses to organize the simulations.\n",
    "The user only needs to provide a generators folder containing one subfolder for each starting conformation containing all files needed to execute that simulation. For example:\n",

    "└── generators/\n",
    "    ├── gen1/\n",
    "    │   ├── structure.pdb\n",

    "    │   ├── input\n",
    "    │   └── ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the adaptive will generate an `input`, `data` and later a `filtered` folder as well, looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "├── data/          # Contains the completed simulations (automatically created)\n",
    "├── filtered/      # Contains the completed simulations without water atoms (automatically created)\n",
    "├── generators/    # Contains the initial generators provided by the user\n",
    "└── input/         # Contains the files needed to start all simulations of all epochs (automatically created)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive uses a naming scheme for simulations which follows the pattern: `e4s3_e2s1p1f45`. This name tells us that this simulation was generated in epoch 4 as the 3rd simulation of the batch. The starting conformation was taken from simulation 1 of epoch 2 from the first piece of the simulation\\* and from frame 45 of that simulation piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* some MD software might fragment simulations into pieces. Usually though this number will be 1 and can be ignored."
