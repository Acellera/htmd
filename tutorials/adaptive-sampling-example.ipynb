    "## Concept\n",
    "* AdaptiveRun executes adaptive runs on a given resource. It starts from a set of initial input directories containing all input files and generates new simulations based on these generators by building a (Markov) model of the data on-the-fly and deciding using a criteria where sampling is more needed.\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adaptive takes one or more generator simulations and construct on-the-fly new input coordinate files for new simulations based on these generators. \n",
    "1. Generator simulations consist individual subdirectories in the ''genereratorpath'' directory. \n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of launching many simulations at once, this scheme launches simulations in sequential batches called epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. At every epoch new input coordinatates are created while velocities are reinitialized to the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution at the given temperature."

    "1. The length of each simulation is really system dependent. \n",
    "1. It could be anything like tens of nanoseconds to hundred of nanoseconds. \n",
    "1. As a rule of thumb use twice the expected lag time for your molecular process (e.g. for binding anything between 30 and 100 ns)."
